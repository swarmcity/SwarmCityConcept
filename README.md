# Season 1

## S01 E01: First Request

In episode 1, Frank is really excited to start using Swarm City. Whenever he gets excited by something, Frank throws himself whole hog into it. And so without delay he creates and posts his first request.

Frank would like someone to translate his "Decentralise Now!" manifesto in exchange for 20 SWT. He posts this request in the marketplace known as #Settler, because #Settler is a place where early adopters go to do such things.

Frank is on /new-request, filling in the description: "Translate my 1 page manifesto from English to Dutch." and the amount: "20 SWT". Frank sets the request's location to "Worldwide". 

After submitting his request, he sees it on page /hashtag (of #Settler). Frank taps on his item to see the detail. In the detail, he finds and then grabs the shareable link and posts it on Facebook.

Who, oh who, will respond to Frank's request?

#### New epics in this episode:

## S01 E02: Request Replies

In episode 2, two people reply to Frank's request.

Alice sees Frank's request on Facebook. She taps it, and gets transported by way of the internet to swarm.city. Here Alice can see the details of the request, and she decides to reply.

Tom is already on Swarm City, specifically on page /hashtag of #Settler. He also is intrigued by Frank's request, and taps it to see the detail. Tom decides to reply as well. 

Frank sees the two replies. Who will he choose?

## S01 E03: The Burden of Choice

In episode 3, Frank has to decide who he wants to choose as a provider for his request.

Frank gets to know the reputation of the repliers, Alice and Tom. Alice's reputation is sketchy, so he chooses Tom to become the Provider.

Tom is very happy, and agrees to the deal. 

Will they successfully complete this deal, or is there a conflict waiting around the corner?

#### New epics in this episode:
- [ ] As a user, I see another user’s reputation so I can interpret it to decide on the trustworthiness of the other user.

## S01 E04: The Successful Deal

In episode 4, Frank and Tom successfully complete a deal.

When a deal is successfully completed both users gain reputation. Frank can view his new reputation, while Tom verifies that he received his SWT. 

Finally Tom's got his SWT. He knows it opens up a whole new world of possibilities. What will he do with his newly gained capital?

https://github.com/swarmcity/SwarmCityConcept/issues/17

## S01 E05: Going Sour
In episode 5 Tom tries to make up his mind about where to post his first request. There are so many possibilities to choose from! 

In order to decide, Tom checks out the information display for several different hashtags to see their conflict/success ratio, and provider/seeker ratio.

He chooses #SCCommShare.

Tom makes a new request and selects Brenda as a provider, which results in a deal between Brenda and Tom. 

Although Brenda agreed to the deal, she never delivers. Tom wonders where she is so he sends her a chat message in their shared deal. 

Brenda replies "Damn, it's just too hard for me, Ton! You want it in what langwage?", which of course makes Tom seriously pissed off, as he is quite anal with spelling. He has to resort to his last option: initiating conflict resolution with the hashtag maintainer. Will Tom get justice?

#### New epics in this episode:
- [ ] As a user I can find the details for a hashtag, so I can learn more about it.

## S01 E06: Finding Peace
In episode 6 we meet Crystal, the Hashtag maintainer. She is responsible for resolving the conflict between Tom and Brenda.

Crystal checks the details of their deal. She joins the chat with Tom and Brenda, and starts communicating with them. She hears both sides of the argument.

Crystal resolves the conflict in favor of Tom. Brenda realizes it was her own fault. (For one thing, spelling your customer's name right is important.) Will she do a better job next time? 

#### New epics in this episode:
- [ ] As a hashtagmaintainer I can resolve conflicts so users have a safe and fair marketplace.
https://hackmd.io/HWL38ETcTv2u5_kAbjwmIg

## S01 E07: Searching New Horizons
In episode 7, Brenda tries to reply to a request on a different hashtag.

Brenda sees the hashtaglist and chooses a different hashtag she's interested in. She learned from her previous mistake, and this time filters the list to only see requests nearby. She concludes she'll have a better chance of fulfilling requests that occur in her general neighborhood.

Brenda sees Gary's request. It's nearby, and it's the amount she's looking for, so she responds to Gary's request. Gary picks Brenda as the provider, but by that time Brenda is passed out on the couch.

Gary loses his patience with Brenda, so he deselects her and picks someone else.

#### New epics in this episode:
- [ ] As a user, I can see all hashtags with the number of completed deals for each hashtag, so I can see the activity in Swarm City. https://hackmd.io/DIjO_Oj_TsCDgUa4RQ0vFw

## S01 E08: Bad Luck Gary

In episode 8, Gary has no luck with his deal, so he just gives up.

After deselecting Brenda, Gary selects Pepe as a Provider. Unfortunaly, Pepe declines which leaves Gary's deal without a Provider. This makes Gary totally fed up with Swarm City, cancelling his deal. Will Gary ever do a new request in Swarm City?

#### New epics in this episode:

- [ ] As a provider, I decline the selection, so I can express I'm no longer interested in fullfilling the request.
https://hackmd.io/LdGriI5uQyqR4DFoXmuPFg


- [ ] As a seeker, I can cancel my request, so the request is no longer on the hashtag.
https://hackmd.io/zL84umAnREmgP0F7fwjgag
